# WeatherApp
- The project aims to develop an application to search and interpret weather history data. The application should be easily extensible. Users must be able to provide their search criteria via the application to retrieve the information from a csv file, or a json file.
- The user can choose to search for a combination of weather-related information (temperature, wind speed, wind direction, and total precipitation) for a given date. If the given date is not complete, as figured in the csv file, or the json file, the application should return the average of the weather-related information. For example, the user could choose to search for the temperature in the year 2015. In this case, the application should retrieve all the temperatures from the year 2015 and return their average.
